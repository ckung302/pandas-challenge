Submission for Pandas homework for Northwestern Data Science Boot Camp

Observations:

1. The majority of individuals purchasing items in this data set are male, with 84.03% of males purchasing items. This resulted in the total purchase value for men to be significantly larger than women and other/non-disclosed individuals. However, the average purchase price per individual was around the same, meaning the difference in purchase count is proportional to the change in total purchase value.

2. The age range of 20-24 years old had the highest amount of total players, as well as purchase count and purchase value. The least amount of players and purchases were those above the age of 40, with the next least amount being those younger than the age of 10.

3. Many of the most popular items also happened to be the most profitable items, meaning that there is most likley a correlation between the popularity and profitability of an item.
